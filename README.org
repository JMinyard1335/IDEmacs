  #+begin_src elisp
    (require 'package)
    (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
			     ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
			     ("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")))

    (package-initialize)

    (use-package IDEmacs
      :load-path "~/Documents/IDEmacs/IDEmacs-0.0.1/"
      :config
      (idemacs/personal-set-path idemacs-personal-default-path)
      (idemacs/school-set-path idemacs-school-default-path)

      (idemacs/refile-set-path idemacs-refile-default-path)
      (idemacs/sidebar-set-path idemacs-sidebar-file-default))

  #+end_src
  This is the bare minimum needed to get the package set up. DONT FORGET TO SET THE CORRECT LOAD-PATH! The load path should be the path to the directory that contains the IDEmacs files. The idemacs/personal-set-path, idemacs/school-set-path, idemacs/home-set-path, idemacs/refile-set-path, and idemacs/sidebar-set-path functions are used to set and create the org files. The default paths can be replaced with a path of your choosing.

  To access idemacs-mode type M-x RET idemacs-mode. Or use the hotkey <F2>.
